1.0.0 Initial release

The initial version of the application. Allows people to select images from their device, add a note and then
select which Pinterest board they should be sent to. Users can select individual boards for each image, or select a
board for all images to be sent to.

Currently the application uses a pretty raw implementation of FileReader to load up images, which is not the best for
performance, but that will be updated in the near future
